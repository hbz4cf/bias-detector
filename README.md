## Executive Summary:

This project builds a lightweight Bias Detector that automates part of that process by classifying opinion headlines into Balanced, Partisan, or Provocative categories. The tool is designed to help writers and editors become more aware of language that may inadvertently push a narrative or heighten polarization.
